# Resources

Over the years we have gathered a list of resources for students.

---

## YouTube Channel

Instructors record every single class and upload the recording to our YouTube Channel: 

**[Python DeCal YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@pythondecal5340/videos)**

The channel has a large catalog of videos, dating back to the Spring 2021 semester. Keep in mind that materials used, academic expectations, and course content change from year-to-year, so older videos may differ from the current version of the course.

## Textbooks 

All of the materials in this section are optional. We do **not** follow a published textbook structure in class, but these can be helpful resources: 

- **Python for Astronomers: An Introduction to Scientific Computing**  
  Written by previous facilitators (Imad Pasha and Christopher Agostino), last updated in 2019.  
  [GitHub Link](https://github.com/prappleizer/prappleizer.github.io)

- **Astronomical Python: An Introduction to Modern Scientific Programming**  
  Official textbook by Imad Pasha, published in May 2024.  
  [IOPscience Link](https://iopscience.iop.org/book/mono/978-0-7503-5147-8)

## Guides

These guides were created by the Python DeCal staff over the years. Many are used as supplemental materials during the semester.

### [The Installation Guide](../../assets/guides/installation_guide.pdf)
**Description:**  
The Installation Guide walks you through how to install all the software you will need for the semester.
Yes, this guide looks very long, but that's mainly because we have included tons of pictures to make the guide easier to follow.
If you run into any bugs or errors (which is completely normal), just reach out in class, on EdStem, or during office hours.
Additionally, if you find any mistakes, please email the head instructor Brianna Peck at bpeck114@berkeley.edu

### [The Git and GitHub Guide (GGG)](../../assets/guides/git_and_github_guide.pdf)
**Description:**  
The Git and GitHub Guide (GGG) is a one-stop guide for helping you through everything related to Git and GitHub for this course.
Topics include, adding, committing, pushing, pulling, branching, etc. 
The Python DeCal works with GitHub throughout the semester, so this guide is helpful if you need a refresher on the foundations of version control with Git.

## Other Links 

Here are some external tools/resources that instructors and previous students have found useful:

- [W3Schools Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp)  
  Provides beginner-friendly explanations and tutorials for Python.

- [Python Guide (by Imad Pasha)](https://prappleizer.github.io/#guides)  
  A collection of demos and notes. Some of this material is beyond the scope of this course, but provide great ideas for Final Projects!
