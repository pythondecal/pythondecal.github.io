# Spring 2025 Final Projects
Please enjoy the final projects of students during the Spring 2025 semester.

## Simulating Tidal Waves with Gravitational Physics 
**Group Members:** Deacon Carreon and Olivia Silvia
The goal for this project was to model the tides of the Earth-Moon-Sun system. To do this, we
simulated the positions of all three objects using equations of gravity and mechanics. With these
distances we simulated the tidal wave heights at any inputted latitude on the Earth, ultimately
putting it into an animation, based on the function parameter of time.
