## Simulating Tidal Waves with Gravitational Physics (test)
**Group Members:** Deacon Carreon and Olivia Silvia

The goal for this project was to model the tides of the Earth-Moon-Sun system. To do this, we
simulated the positions of all three objects using equations of gravity and mechanics. With these
distances we simulated the tidal wave heights at any inputted latitude on the Earth, ultimately
putting it into an animation, based on the function parameter of time.

## Mass-Radius Relations of Neutron Stars
**Group Members:** Eva Li, Serina Mummert

This project investigates the mass-radius relationship found in neutron stars, the most
dense observable objects known to astronomers today. Utilizing python, we model
theoretical predictions for neutron star structures based upon packages including the
readily found solutions to the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff(TOV) equations and various
equations of state(EOS).

We compare these theoretical calculations to our observational data collected from
pulsars, x-ray binaries, and gravitational wave events. The goal is to enhance our
understanding of and find meaningful connections between observed neutron stars and
known theoretical predictions.

## Dark Matter Distribution of a Quasar-Galaxy Lensing System
**Group Members:** Charlie Beckner

My project is focused on plotting the distribution of dark matter of the galaxy in the gravitational
lensing system, DES J0408-5354. The main galaxy is bending the light of a distant quasar
behind it, creating three distinct lensing images and a clear Einstein radius arching around the
galaxy. To do this, I will utilize data about the system to find the mass of the dark matter
enclosed within the Einstein radius. I will then fit a mass-density model to find the scale radius
and scale density which I will then use to plot the density as a function of radius from the center
of the galaxy to visualize the distribution. To confirm my model is properly fitting the data, I
have generated mock test data.

## Rotation Curve of the Milky Way Evidence for Dark Matter Halos
**Group Members:** Max Velasquez and Xavier Silva

This project aims to explore and simulate our galaxy’s rotation curve, comparing
theoretical Keplerian models with observed velocity data to illustrate the need for dark
matter. We used real data from Eilers et al. (2019) on the Milky Way’s circular velocity
curve, the project analyzes how star velocities behave at different galactic radii.

## Faraday's Law
**Group Members:** Aviva Franklin

In this project, I will be measuring the motion of a spring oscillating at 60 degrees, 
and then fit that data to different models to determine the best equation of motion 
for the system. This will involve data generation, data analysis, finding a curve of 
best fit with errors, and analyzing the results.

## Creating Light Curves from Kepler Data
**Group Members:** Colin Keel

The goal of this project was to create a program that takes in data from the Kepler Space
Telescope and turns that data into a light curve for a specified Kepler target from which
brightness dips associated with exoplanet transits can be clearly observed. The packages used in
this project are numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, lightkurve, batman, and scipy.optimize. The two that I
found to be the most useful were lightkurve and batman; however, these were both unfamiliar to
me upon starting this project, so a good amount of time was spent figuring out how to use them.
Lightkurve was used to search for and download the data, filter the data and remove outliers, and
stitch the data into actual light curves. Batman was used to import the Mandel and Agol transit
model that was used to fit the data.

## Gravity Knights: FIGHT GRAVITY WITH OUR ROCKET LANDING SIMULATOR!!!
**Group Members:** Jean Gonzalez and Audrey Lee-Gardner
**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/Jeans617/Python_project_folder 

Our initial goal with Gravity Knights was to create a 2D arcade-style game simulating
real-world physics, but we weren’t initially sure what the premise of our game would be. We
initially thought of making a game in which you shoot enemies with a spaceship, but this concept
has been done so many times before and wouldn’t lend well to the “physics-based” concept we
had. With this realization, we finally came up with the idea of having to fight the pull of gravity
with an opposing force, a simple physics concept that most players should be familiar with, but
implemented in a challenging way. Once we had the concept for our game, our main goal was to
implement it in a way that was user-friendly, fun to play, and even educational.

## Analyzing Orbital Properties of KOI Systems
**Group Members:** Kaitlyn Le

In this final project, I analyzed the relationship between orbital properties among the KOI
planetary systems. The goal of this project was to discover trends with the relationships between
planetary mass, radius, and orbital period by applying statistical methods, model fitting, and
residual analysis. I explored the mass-period and radius-period relationships while utilizing
power-law models to fit the data.

## Modeling The Relative Chemical Abundances From Type 1A Supernova Explosions
**Group Members:** Shivani Kulkarni and Melanie Miu

For this project, we used data from Type 1a supernova explosions taken from the Carnegie
Supernova Project (see citation at the end) to create a model that will estimate the relative
chemical abundances of a Type 1a supernovae. This project includes the use of graphing
packages as well as isolating data to figure out which elements are being formed specifically in
each explosion. We used this data to graph a single spectra for a single supernova explosion to
see how we can extract information about the chemicals released in the explosion and then create
our final model of the relative abundances of all the supernovae in our data collection. We did
this by using python and python libraries (will go over in more detail in Methods section) to
combine the data and take the average of the elemental fluxes.

## Near Earth CometSimulator
**Group Members:** Sareena Mann

There are about 37,000 active Near Earth Objects, and about 2,500 of which are
considered potentially hazardous (CNEOS). Therefore, understanding their orbits and how
factors such as eccentricity affect their potential trajectories. In this project report, I outline the
approach I took to analyze the trajectories of Near Earth comets. Near Earth objects are defined
as objects with trajectories within 1.3 AU of the Sun and therefore within 0.3 AU of the Earth’s
orbit (UNOOSA). I will use data provided by NASA’s Open Portal to animate the orbits of 160
Near Earth Orbits and to simulate how including random noise in the data affects the predicted
orbits.

## HWC: ESI and CMF of Exoplanets
**Group Members:** Brandon Pestoni 

Within the Habitable Worlds Catalog (HWC), there are over 5000 exoplanets recorded with most
having specific physical parameters cataloged that determine their specificity in terms of what
kind of exoplanet it is and how it compared to planets that we know of in our own solar system.
They have different data sets that are either reduced based on certain physical parameters but
for the sake of this project, I decided to take the raw data set and do the filtering on my own,
as we will see in the coming pages.

## Other Projects


### Metabolic Guessing Game: Progression to Type 2 Diabetes
**Group Members:** Tushita Wadhawan
**GitHub:** https://github.com/twadhawan0001/tushita decal
For my final project, I developed a Python-based interactive guessing game that teaches users about the
progression of metabolic diseases, specifically focusing on type 2 diabetes. This project combines educational
biology content with programming to create an engaging and interactive experience. The game prompts users
to guess key biology terms related to the disease timeline and rewards correct or completed guesses with
visual animations that illustrate the physiological changes occurring in the body

### Shooting Game
**Group Members:** Yuang Li

I plan to make a mini shooting game, there will be bot enemies shooting at you, and you
have to also avoid obstacles from getting HP down. You get scores by destroying enemies.
There’s also a time limit. Win/lose condition: win by survive, lose if you’re not. It could be
spaceships or just playing volleyballs.
