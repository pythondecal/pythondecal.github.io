## Simulating Tidal Waves with Gravitational Physics 
**Group Members:** Deacon Carreon and Olivia Silvia

The goal for this project was to model the tides of the Earth-Moon-Sun system. To do this, we
simulated the positions of all three objects using equations of gravity and mechanics. With these
distances we simulated the tidal wave heights at any inputted latitude on the Earth, ultimately
putting it into an animation, based on the function parameter of time.

## Mass-Radius Relations of Neutron Stars
**Group Members:** Eva Li, Serina Mummert

This project investigates the mass-radius relationship found in neutron stars, the most
dense observable objects known to astronomers today. Utilizing python, we model
theoretical predictions for neutron star structures based upon packages including the
readily found solutions to the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff(TOV) equations and various
equations of state(EOS).

We compare these theoretical calculations to our observational data collected from
pulsars, x-ray binaries, and gravitational wave events. The goal is to enhance our
understanding of and find meaningful connections between observed neutron stars and
known theoretical predictions.

## Dark Matter Distribution of a Quasar-Galaxy Lensing System
**Group Members:** Charlie Beckner

My project is focused on plotting the distribution of dark matter of the galaxy in the gravitational
lensing system, DES J0408-5354. The main galaxy is bending the light of a distant quasar
behind it, creating three distinct lensing images and a clear Einstein radius arching around the
galaxy. To do this, I will utilize data about the system to find the mass of the dark matter
enclosed within the Einstein radius. I will then fit a mass-density model to find the scale radius
and scale density which I will then use to plot the density as a function of radius from the center
of the galaxy to visualize the distribution. To confirm my model is properly fitting the data, I
have generated mock test data.

## Rotation Curve of the Milky Way Evidence for Dark Matter Halos
**Group Members:** Max Velasquez and Xavier Silva

This project aims to explore and simulate our galaxy’s rotation curve, comparing
theoretical Keplerian models with observed velocity data to illustrate the need for dark
matter. We used real data from Eilers et al. (2019) on the Milky Way’s circular velocity
curve, the project analyzes how star velocities behave at different galactic radii.

## Faraday's Law
**Group Members:** Aviva Franklin

In this project, I will be measuring the motion of a spring oscillating at 60 degrees, 
and then fit that data to different models to determine the best equation of motion 
for the system. This will involve data generation, data analysis, finding a curve of 
best fit with errors, and analyzing the results.

## Creating Light Curves from Kepler Data
**Group Members:** Colin Keel

The goal of this project was to create a program that takes in data from the Kepler Space
Telescope and turns that data into a light curve for a specified Kepler target from which
brightness dips associated with exoplanet transits can be clearly observed. The packages used in
this project are numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, lightkurve, batman, and scipy.optimize. The two that I
found to be the most useful were lightkurve and batman; however, these were both unfamiliar to
me upon starting this project, so a good amount of time was spent figuring out how to use them.
Lightkurve was used to search for and download the data, filter the data and remove outliers, and
stitch the data into actual light curves. Batman was used to import the Mandel and Agol transit
model that was used to fit the data.

## Gravity Knights: FIGHT GRAVITY WITH OUR ROCKET LANDING SIMULATOR!!!
**Group Members:** Jean Gonzalez and Audrey Lee-Gardner
**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/Jeans617/Python_project_folder 

Our initial goal with Gravity Knights was to create a 2D arcade-style game simulating
real-world physics, but we weren’t initially sure what the premise of our game would be. We
initially thought of making a game in which you shoot enemies with a spaceship, but this concept
has been done so many times before and wouldn’t lend well to the “physics-based” concept we
had. With this realization, we finally came up with the idea of having to fight the pull of gravity
with an opposing force, a simple physics concept that most players should be familiar with, but
implemented in a challenging way. Once we had the concept for our game, our main goal was to
implement it in a way that was user-friendly, fun to play, and even educational.

## Other Projects

### Shooting Game
**Group Members:** Yuang Li

I plan to make a mini shooting game, there will be bot enemies shooting at you, and you
have to also avoid obstacles from getting HP down. You get scores by destroying enemies.
There’s also a time limit. Win/lose condition: win by survive, lose if you’re not. It could be
spaceships or just playing volleyballs.
