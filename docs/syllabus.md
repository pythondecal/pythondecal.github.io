# Course Description

This course offers an introduction to the Python programming language with an emphasis on **data analysis** and **scientific
research in astronomy and physics.** Python is one of the most common programming languages used by modern
astronomers, and this class focuses on preparing undergraduate intended/declared astronomy students for **upper-division
laboratory courses and research.** However, students from all backgrounds are welcome to apply.
Key topics include the command line, VS Code, scripting, version control with Git, documentation, Jupyter Notebooks, and
common Python packages/libraries. We’ll also cover advanced topics such as curve-fitting, processing FITS files, querying
databases, animation, and object-oriented programming.

The Python DeCal is designed for students with little or no prior programming experience. However, learning the technical
material covered in this course—especially for beginners—requires **dedication, patience, and regular practice.** Many
students find this workload more demanding than other lower-division DeCals at UC Berkeley. If you have already taken
advanced computer science or data science courses at Berkeley or elsewhere, this class may not be the best fit for you. But
if you are excited to explore how coding can be applied to astronomical research, we still encourage you to apply.

Everyone’s “learning to code” journey will be different. Some concepts may click quickly, while others take time. **Your
effort on homework and the Final Project will directly shape what you gain from the Python DeCal.** We
strongly recommend attending all lectures and discussions, but attendance is not strictly required since each lecture is
recorded and posted to our class YouTube Channel. To get the most out of this course, complete homeworks to the best of
your ability (with little to no help from AI tools), attend office hours regularly, and put meaningful effort into your Final
Project. If you need help, please reach out. We have a large team, so we can give as many students as possible one-on-one
support.

# Learning Objectives

Students will be introduced to **fundamental programming concepts** with the goal of building proficiency in developing
software for **upper-division astronomy laboratory work** and **scientific research** using Python. In addition to com-
pleting weekly homework and lecture engagement assignments, students will demonstrate their understanding of version
control, **scripting, packages/libraries** (i.e., NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, SciPy, Astropy), and **software structure
and flow** by designing and creating a **Final Project** of their choice.

This project will culminate in an **open-source GitHub repository** containing the Final Project and a **Final Presen-
tation** during the last week of instruction. The presentation will give students practice in **scientific communication,** a
skill required for upper-division astronomy coursework and jobs in academia.

# Course Materials & Resources

Students are expected to bring and use their own computers for the duration of this course. If you are unable to
obtain a laptop, please consider utilizing the [Student Technology Equity Program (STEP)](https://studenttech.berkeley.edu/step) which offers **semester-long
computer rentals.** If the STEP program is not a suitable option, **reach out to the Python DeCal course staff** and
we can help arrange alternative accommodations.

## Required Readings

There are **no required readings** outside of material provided during lecture, discussion, and the guides. However, we
recommend two **optional textbooks** written by former Python DeCal instructors:

- **Python for Astronomers: An Introduction to Scientific Computing**  
  Written by previous facilitators (Imad Pasha and Christopher Agostino), last updated in 2019.  
  [GitHub Link](https://github.com/prappleizer/prappleizer.github.io)

- **Astronomical Python: An Introduction to Modern Scientific Programming**  
  Official textbook by Imad Pasha, published in May 2024.  
  [IOPscience Link](https://iopscience.iop.org/book/mono/978-0-7503-5147-8)

For additional reference on the packages/libraries we use throughout the semester, you may find these **optional docu-
mentation links** helpful:

- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
- [SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/)
- [Astropy](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/index.html)

## bCourses

All course-related content will be available on our **bCourses** site, unless otherwise noted:
- **Lecture materials, homeworks, demos, rubrics, and guides** −→ posted under the **Files** section
- **Important updates and reminders** −→ posted under the **Announcements** section
- **Syllabus** −→ posted under the **Syllabus** section
- **Office hours** −→ posted under the **Home** section
- **Grades** −→ posted under the **Grades** section

## Office Hours
Office hours provide a dedicated space for students to ask questions and collaborate with peers outside of regular class
times. We strongly encourage attending office hours weekly and taking the opportunity to connect with the Python DeCal
staff, especially at the beginning of the semester. Even if you don’t have any course-related questions, you’re welcome
to drop by—we’re happy to offer guidance on selecting or declaring a major, finding research opportunities or exploring
summer programs on/off campus.

However, please note that course-related questions will take priority during office hours. As Final Project deadlines
approach, office hours tend to get busier, so plan accordingly when seeking assistance. The finalized office hours scheduled
will be posted to bCourses by the end of the second week.

## Grading Breakdown
- **Participation 10%**
- **Homework 60%**
- **Final Project 30%**

**A grade of 70% or above AND an attempt on the final project is required to pass this class.**

### Attendance & Participation (10% of your grade)

Class meets twice a week. Most weeks will follow a structure of a lecture on Monday to introduce new material, followed
by a discussion on Wednesday where you’ll practice applying concepts through hands-on coding exercises. Discussions
are collaborative and informal, with course staff available to assist as your work through guided problems.
Please bring your laptops to all lectures and discussions so you can follow along and participate actively. However,
during warm-ups we may ask you to put away your computers and write your answers on paper.

In addition to regular class meetings, we will have a few dedicated Final Project workdays later in the semester. These
sessions are meant to give you time to make progress on your projects, and receive real-time support from the course
staff.

If you are unable to attend a class section, recordings of lectures will be uploaded to our YouTube channel and linked
on the bCourses homepage. While asynchronous access is available, we strongly encourage attending in person when
possible——especially since course content and delivery may change from year to year.

Attendance is not required or tracked. However, we will assign occasional participation assignments throughout the
semester to help you stay on track. These are brief tasks (10-30 minutes) and are designed to support your learning——not
add to your workload like a full homework assignment.

### Homework (60% of your grade)

Homework is assigned weekly and due the following Monday at 11:59 PM on Gradescope via your GitHub repository.
Homework will reinforce material from lectures and encourage hands-on exploration of new concepts.

- There is no penalty for late submissions within a 2-week grace period from the original due date. If you
need even more time, please reach out for accommodations.
- Homework is graded on effort and accuracy. You’ll earn most of the points as long as you show clear thought and
honest attempts——even if your answers aren’t fully correct.
- Collaboration is allowed, but each student must submit their own original work. Avoid direct use of AI-
generated answers to preserve your learning experience.

Homework will be assigned weekly, covering topics discussed in lectures. Homework will be released on Tuesdays after class
and will be due the following Tuesday at 11:59 PM, unless otherwise specified, giving you a full week to complete it. All
homework must be submitted on Gradescope via the GitHub repository you will set up in class. We offer a 2-week grace
period for submitting late homework after the original due date, with no penalty applied. If you need additional time
beyond this, please contact the course staff to discuss accommodations.

We highly recommend putting an honest effort into homework, as it is graded on both effort and accuracy. Points are
primarily deducted based on the level of effort shown. For instance, if your answer is incorrect but demonstrates a solid
attempt and understanding, you will receive most of the points. The homework is designed to reinforce your knowledge, as
this is a Pass/No Pass course.

You are encourage to collaborate with other students; however, everyone must submit their own individual work. While
we encourage resources like Google for research and learning, please refrain from directly inputting homework questions
in ChatGPT or other AI tools to generate answers. The goal of this course is to develop your own understanding of the
material, and relying too heavily on AI can hinder that learning process. Misuse of AI-generated content will be considered
a violation of academic integrity. With great power comes great responsibility.

### Final Project (30% of your grade)
The Final Project is your chance to apply the skills you’ve learned throughout the semester in a creative, research-relevant,
or data-driven way. Projects may include data analysis, simulations visualization, or exploration of a topic of interest in
astronomy or physics using Python.

You may work individually or in pairs (2 students max). Completion of the Final Project——including the final
presentation——is mandatory to pass this course.

#### Timeline and Checkpoints:
- **Week 7**: You will be assigned a staff mentor to support your project. You must attend at least one office hours of
your mentor to complete a check-in assignment before submitting your project proposal to discuss your ideas and get
feedback.
-  **Week 11**: Project Proposals will be due. Details and format will be released on bCourses.
- **Weeks 12-14**: Ongoing second mentor check-ins. You’re expected to check-in at least once more with your mentor
during the project development phase. Your mentor is your primary point of contact for support and feedback.
- **Week 15**: Final Project Presentations! You will give a 1-3 minute presentation (with slides or visual aid) to
share your project with the class.

#### Expectations:
- Projects should demonstrate your understanding of Python coding concepts, especially those covered in class.
- You are encouraged to explore your academic interests, whether through astronomy datasets (e.g. FITS files),
simulations, or creative coding applications (like designing a video game).
• We will provide example project ideas and offer brainstorming guidance in class and on EdStem.

## Academic Misconduct
As with all classes, cheating, plagiarism, and other forms of academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. First violations will
result in a zero on the assignment, and any subsequent violations may result in administrative action in accordance with
the UC Berkeley Astronomy Department Policy on Academic Misconduct.
