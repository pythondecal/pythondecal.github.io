# Resources

Over the years we have gathered a list of resources for students. 

## YouTube Channel

The Python DeCal records every single class and uploads the recording to our YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/@pythondecal5340/videos

We have a large catalog dating back to Spring 2021. Material, expectations and content change year-to-year in the Python DeCal so keep that in mind if you watch previous videos.

## Textbooks 

All of the following materials are optional. We do not follow the structure of a published textbook. However, there was a course text called **Python for Astronomers: An Introduction to Scientific Computing** written by a previous facilliators (Imad Pasha and Christopher Agostino) that was lasted updated in 2019. It is currently available as a text on GitHub:

https://github.com/prappleizer/prappleizer.github.io


Imad Pasha also published an offical textbook called **Astronomical Python: An introduction to modern scientific programming** in May 2024: https://iopscience.iop.org/book/mono/978-0-7503-5147-8

## Guides

These following guides were developed by the Python DeCal staff over the years. Many of them are used as supplemental materials throughout the semester:

[Installation Guide](../../assets/guides/installation_guide.pdf)

**Description**: Welcome to the Python DeCal Installation Guide! This document will walk you through how to
install all the software you’ll need for the semester.
While we’ve tried to make every step as clear as possible, you might still run into a bug or error.
This is totally normal. No stress! If anything goes wrong, please feel free to reach out to a Python
DeCal staff member in class, on EdStem, or during office hours.
We are a bit short on time, so please try to get through these steps as soon as your can. This
guide may look long, but that’s mostly because we included lots of pictures to guide you through
the installation process. Best of luck!

[Git and GitHub Guide (GGG)](../../assets/guides/git_and_github_guide.pdf)

**Description:** Welcome to the Git and GitHub Guide (informally known as the GGG). This guide is meant to be
a place to help you use Git and GitHub on a daily basis. During this course you will be expected
to use GitHub in a variety of ways: adding, committing, pushing, cloning, pulling, branching, etc!
A lot of students in the past have requested a one-stop place for how to Git and GitHub so we
finally decided to put all that information here.
Best of luck!
